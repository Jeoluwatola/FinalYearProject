# FinalYearProject
This is an E-learning platform web application with configured analytics (Google Analytics) that I created for my final year project at Covenant University. This web app was fully developed and deployed on Google Cloud Platform.
The frontend was developed using html,css and Javascript while the backend was developed using the flask framework and written in python.
The database used is BigQuery on GCP and data is accessed using SQL.
